# korex-server
> Node.js server for xat.com swf files.

## Support
* **Windows**
* **Linux**
* **Mac**

## Install
``$ npm install xat-server`` or `` $ git clone https://github.com/iiegor/xat-server ``

The server depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and other packages that are downloaded and installed during the install process.

## Deploy
`` $ npm install ``
This command will create a folder called *.src*, this will be the dist folder for the coffee-script located at the *src* folder. If you want to use your compiled coffee-script code, change the value of the variable *compiled* to true in the *bin/korex file*.

At last, run this command to start the server.
```sh
$ npm start
```
